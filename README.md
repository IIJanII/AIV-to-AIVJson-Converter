# Description
Tool features:
- convert .aiv files to .aivjson files
- convert "apple farm" to "bedouin stockade" for bedouin lords
- convert chosen units to bedouin units for bedouin lords

Under [aiv/IIJanII_aivs](src/aiv/IIJanII_aivs) you will find my created Castles, one for each old lord. With them works the conversion fine.

This tool was tested on windows. For mac or linux users there might be some issues.

# Credits
Special thanks to gynt and his team from "Sourcehold"! They did the most work decoding the .aiv files. See [Sourcehold](https://github.com/sourcehold/sourcehold-maps) for more information.

Thanks also to the UCP team, from where I got the inspiration for the design. Visit them here: [UCP](https://unofficialcrusaderpatch.github.io)

And thanks to Firefly for developing the Stronghold Crusader Definitive Edition!")
